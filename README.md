# Elastop - Elasticsearch Terminal Dashboard

Elastop is a terminal-based dashboard for monitoring Elasticsearch clusters in real-time. It provides a comprehensive view of cluster health, node status, indices, and various performance metrics in an easy-to-read terminal interface. This tool was designed to look visually similar HTOP.

## Features

- Real-time cluster monitoring
- Node status and resource usage
- Index statistics and write rates
- Search and indexing performance metrics
- Memory usage and garbage collection stats
- Network and disk I/O monitoring
- Color-coded health status indicators
- Role-based node classification
- Version compatibility checking

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

cd elastop
go build
```

## Usage

```bash
./elastop [flags]
